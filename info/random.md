"Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list"

**The path of** 
1. believing you are in control
2. realizing you are being controlled
3. finding that your controller is yourself
4. realizing you can never be free

memcopy is my favorite operation

The notion of sprinting towards a wall and right before you collide with it, it disapears.

"We're here"
"Where?"
"At our destination"
"Which is where?"
"The place we are meant to be"
"Where is that?"
"Here"

When to think vs. when trial and error
You must think when you are making design descisions, when you are asking yourself "What do I want?"
You must use trial and error when you are looking for the best solution, when asking yourself "What's the best way to do this?"
