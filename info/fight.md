### **Mechanics**

**DBNO**
- In teamplay, when a player reaches zero health, thay enter a dbno state. In order to finish a dbno player, an enemy must melee them. If the dbno player does not get meleed by an opponent for 7 seconds, they will be revivied with 50% hp.

**Disadvantage States**
- **Stagger**: basically every attack applies this, you are unable to perform any action for a short duration. (aka hitstun)
- **Sweep**: send to recovery
- **Root**: immobilized until the duration of the root expires
- **Knockup**: unable to perform any action until you recover. Getting staggered while knocked up will re knock you up, allowing opponents to juggle you.
- **Stun**: unable to perform any action until the next time you are hit, or the duration of the stun expires
